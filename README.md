# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction — Machine Learning

This project predicts a student's **Math Score** using a Machine Learning model trained with academic performance and study-related factors.  
The model uses **Linear Regression** and achieves a performance of **R² Score = 0.88**.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze student data and identify key factors affecting performance
- Build a regression model to predict Math Scores
- Perform EDA, preprocessing, and model evaluation
